1.0.0 - Release version (5-June-2017)

1.0.1 - Release version (16-June-2017)
	> Modification:
		1. [critical] Fixed error in DataBase handler. Sometime server crashed when queued data for CLASS_C device is requested from DB
		2. [moderate] Fixed other problems of data base handler deal with CLASS_C device handler
		3. [moderate] Fixed some problems with CLASS_C device-packet handler:
			- was multiple events of receiving one answer frome device. Therefore online user receive multiple notifications for one packet;
			- all devices is processed as CLASS_A devices (when receive uplink packet);
			- correct downlink to first receive window (RX1);
			- when is exist downlink queue, received messages is not processed. Now, before transmition of downlink message, handler looks for received messages.
		4. [minor] Fixed some uncorrect moment with console output:
			- correct port indication for downlink packets;
			- represent software version at start server;
			
1.0.2 - Release version (10-July-2017)
	> Modification:
		1. [moderate] Add server ip address configuration into setting.conf file. Before server launch need to midify this settings to correct value!
	+ Versions
		1. Add DEB installation packets for linux x32 and x64 versions

1.1.0 - Release version (31-August-2017)
	> Modification:
		1. [critical] Used new version of API: eliminate invalid words in commands such as "bs", "macBs", "base station" towards "gateway" and "gatewayId"; add some new option for device settings and others. 
Therefore there is new version of AdminTool; previous version of AdminTool doesn't work correctly with new server version
		2. [critical] In common: improve reliability of working with CLASS_C devices
		3. [moderate] Improve functioning with CLASS_C devices:
			- for downlink messages ABP or OTAA keys choose automatically in dependency of last received message. So ABP and OTAA activation methods could be changed on fly;
			- remove constrant for maximum number of try for downlink if used downlink queue;
			- append new parameter: usage qownlink queue for CLASS_C devices or use only online downlink method
		4. [moderate] Now allowed to transmit MAC packets for device [port = 0]. All results is on user's conscience
		5. [moderate] Queue of downlink packets is cleared when received JOIN_REQUEST packet
		6. [moderate] Adaptive data rate (ADR) algorithm is realized:
			- separate flag "serverAdrEnable" that allow to functioning server ADR algorithm (in API for corresponding device);
			- algorithm looking for SNR value and if SNR is bigger then -10dBm at 5 times - DR is growing up, 
and if SNR is lower then -10dBm - DR is growing down;
			- as actual power is used "preferPower" parameter value. If this parameter is changed algorithm quickly change it on device
		7. [moderate] "Full duplex" gateway (with "companion" gateway) is tested
		8. [moderate] In API add parameter "lastOnline" that contain time of receiving last keepalive message. Exist in response if gateway is offline
		9. [moderate] Append some moments with debug console output:
			- add regulation for maximum message level shown in console (in config file);
			- add possibility for saving some message levels in LOG file (in config file)
		10.[moderate] Improvements deal with "users":	
			- when token-authorization is used - token is not modified. So there are possible to make some connections for one session;
			- new option: enable or disable receiving console information for all users
		11.[moderate] SSL is now supported. There are several setting:
			- enable or disable using of SSL;
			- filenames for certificate and key files (this files should be in server directory)
		12.[moderate] Some other internal modfications that improve reliability of working with API and devices
		
1.1.1 - Release version (26-September-2017)
	> Modification:
		1. [critical] Solved problem with "user" fuctional (if current user change one parameters - server close all connection)
		2. [moderate] Increase possible traffic for class C devices (decrease timings betwean packets);
		3. [minor] All downlink queue packets are cleared at server startup;
		4. [moderate] Processed user's passwords: now it saved into MD5 hash
		5. [critical] Solved problem with class C device immediate transmission (all immediate transmition was with DR0 data rate)
		6. [moderate] Some iprovments in ADR functionality
		7. [moderate] Iprove total reliability. Some of most significant:
			- add simple (for now) self-test functional for devices handler that try to catch bugs and fix it in auto mode;
			- improve reliability of device handler
		8. [minor] Some changes deal with console output and LOG:
			- save server version into LOG file at server startup;
			- add some new debug information about class C device processing
	-> API:
		9. Add new commands:
			- "get_coverage_map_req" and "get_coverage_map_resp";
			- "get_device_downlink_queue_req" and "get_device_downlink_queue_resp";
			- "manage_device_downlink_queue_req" and "manage_device_downlink_queue_resp"
		10. Take into account standart "null" value for JSON parameters (need for large-scale testing)
			
1.1.2 - Release version (26-October-2017)
	>Modification:

		1. [critical] Modification in class C device workflow:
			- solve problem when device handler is hanged (when downlink queue is disabled);
			- to avoid potental problems server not send downlink in RX2 window that between end of TX and start of RX1 window
			- packet counter is always increased even if packet hasn't be sent (i.e. collision errors from gateways).
		2. [moderate] Some improvements for class A workflow: if downlink into RX1 window is unsuccesfully server try to send downlink into RX2 window;
		3. [moderate] Correct value of ACK flag into "rx" API messages from server. If ACK is true - it means that current downlink or uplink packet contains ACK flag (confirmation for previous confirmed uplink or downlink packet);
		4. [moderate] Fixed some proplems and tested functional for "rxOnly" gateways;
		5. [moderate] Add functional for working with external database (new settings group into configuration file). Now supported SQLITE and MYSQL database types.
			
1.1.5 - Release version (15-January-2018)

		2. [critical] Fix error with database that don't let modify application data (commands "manage_device_appdata");
		3. [moderate] Continue work with selftests. Now server collect info about possibles crashes and send it into anonymous email to VegaAbsolute's developers (of couse if this option is enabled into configuration file, see "selftest settings" area);
		4. [moderate] There are new build configuration for server - server for ARM architecture. Now server can work on gateway!
		5. [minor] Decrease volume of debug info console and LOG file.
